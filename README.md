# Serge√Ø Malwares detector

Detect potentially malicious PHP files.
Based on <https://github.com/jvoisin/php-malware-finder> by jvoisin for the regex rules. Thanks to him.
Added suspicious namings in string and variable tokens.

## Version

1.03-beta

## Requirements

PHP >= 5.3

## Usage

```php mw.php [directory] [-R] [-i] [-lw [whitelistName]]```

- -R : Recursive
- -i : ignore. Don't ask user prompt
- -lw : Learn and whitelist.

## Examples

```php mw.php ../WordPress/ -R```

Scan the directory ```../Wordpress``` recursively and ask an user action if a broken rule is detected.

```php mw.php ../WordPress/ -R -i```

Scan the directory ```../Wordpress``` recursively but ignore prompt. It's an overall seeing.

```php mw.php ../phpmyadmin/ -R -lw "phpmyadmin 4.1"```

Scan the ```../phpmyadmin/``` directory considered safe and whitelist the files breaking the standard rules in the "phpmyadmin 4.1" whitelist. See "whitelisted.json".
